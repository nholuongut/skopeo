## NAME
skopeo\-delete - Mark _image-name_ for deletion.

## SYNOPSIS
**skopeo delete** _image-name_

Mark _image-name_ for deletion.  To release the allocated disk space, you must login to the container registry server and execute the container registry garbage collector. E.g.,

```
/usr/bin/registry garbage-collect /etc/docker-distribution/registry/config.yml

Note: sometimes the config.yml is stored in /etc/docker/registry/config.yml

If you are running the container registry inside of a container you would execute something like:

$ docker exec -it registry /usr/bin/registry garbage-collect /etc/docker-distribution/registry/config.yml

```

**--authfile** _path_

  Path of the authentication file. Default is ${XDG_RUNTIME\_DIR}/nholuongut/auth.json, which is set using `podman login`.
  If the authorization state is not found there, $HOME/.docker/config.json is checked, which is set using `docker login`.

**--creds** _username[:password]_ for accessing the registry

**--cert-dir** _path_ Use certificates at _path_ (*.crt, *.cert, *.key) to connect to the registry

**--tls-verify** _bool-value_ Require HTTPS and verify certificates when talking to container registries (defaults to true)

**--no-creds** _bool-value_ Access the registry anonymously.

Additionally, the registry must allow deletions by setting `REGISTRY_STORAGE_DELETE_ENABLED=true` for the registry daemon.

## EXAMPLES

Mark image example/pause for deletion from the registry.example.com registry:
```sh
$ skopeo delete --force docker://registry.example.com/example/pause:latest
```
See above for additional details on using the command **delete**.
